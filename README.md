This book is written as a textbook on Fundamentals of Python Programming
for Beginners. The primary aim is to help students grasp the basic
fundamentals of Python Programming in a clear and systematic manner. The
book strives to introduce students and engineers to programming in Python
through simple explanations, incorporating recent developments, and
drawing comparisons between theoretical concepts and real-world
applications. The text employs plain and lucid language to elucidate the
subject’s core ideas.
This book covers the basic fundamentals of Python Programming and is
designed to make concepts easy to understand with very simple examples. It
includes numerous illustrations and practical demonstrations to provide
essential technical knowledge in a straightforward manner, thereby
facilitating easy comprehension for students. Exercises are also included at
the end of chapters to test and strengthen understanding.
All five units are thoroughly addressed both theoretically and through
problem-solving.
A significant number of examination-oriented problems are solved to
reinforce theoretical concepts. The book’s orientation towards examinations
is further reflected in the inclusion of solutions to previous university
question papers. This book will be valuable not only to students in
engineering and polytechnic colleges but also to teachers. We warmly
welcome and highly appreciate suggestions for improving this book.
